Abstract:
Summary:
	There are a few assumptions that you can make about the world, and play out the consequences in a [[realist politics]] scenario. 
	1. The state is the highest player in an anarchic world order. There is no higher authority above states. No country can call 911 if there's aggression. 
	2. Every state has some offensive military capabilities. Varying wildly.
	3. You cannot be sure about the intentions of another state. And you certainly cannot be sure about FUTURE intentions. This is opposed to capabilities which involve material measurements. Intentions on the other hand are up in the air.
	4. States prioritize their existence. Survival is number 1 in the list of priorities.
	5. States are basically rational actors. (Strategic calculators)
	These lead to a behavior dictated by fear.
		It is always possible to end up next to nazi Germany or imperial Japan.
		There is no great power that you can call. No 911.
		The most useful strategy is to be so powerful that people will not want to attack you.
	You generally want to be the hegemon in the system. But being a global hegemon is too difficult. The best you can do is be a 'regional hegemon'.
	Being the most powerful in your region comes with certain benefits
