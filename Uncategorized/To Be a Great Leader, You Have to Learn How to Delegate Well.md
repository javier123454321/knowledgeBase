Abstract:
Summary:
	There is a wish to hold on to tasks as you build out your project, but there is a simple limit to what can be done by an individual, no matter how effective.
	>  The upper limit of whatâ€™s possible will increase only with each collaborator you empower to contribute their best work to your shared priorities. Likewise, your power decreases with every initiative you unnecessarily hold on to.
	Being busy is not the same as being productive, likewise, being involved is not the same as being essential.
	As a leader, your goal is to shape priorities, but not to shape plans. You need to trust they will get done in accordance to what is best.
	**Start with your reasons.**
		You cannot motivate someone without spelling out the *Why*
	**Inspire their commitment.**
		People get excited about the why, but they need to understand that *their* involvement is neccesary and how it fits to the big picture.
	**Engage at the right level.**
		Be involved, only to the degree that matters. Too involved means micro-managing. Too disingaged, you miss the opportunity to direct the thing to where it needs to go.
