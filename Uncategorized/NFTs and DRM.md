Abstract:
Summary:
	NFTs do not grant you the rights to stop reproducing an image or a digital file. Every chance we have had to try to stop the reproduction of digital information, we have failed. Digital Rights Management has been a problem ever since the internet was created.
	The zero marginal cost associated with reproducing digital information has created a situation where all of our information is free. Digital art cannot be scarce because information, to be distributed in a computer network needs to be replicated. If I upload an image to Facebook, I own the image. When you go to my profile to see that image, you download the blueprint for your browser to reproduce that image locally. This is how we 'send' stuff online. We don't send the stuff, we send the instructions for your computer to replicate the stuff.
	While the zero marginal cost of replicating online information is incredibly liberating in many ways, it also puts a limit in the amount of value that digital property can acquire. We don't put a monetary value on wind or sun, because for all intents and purposes, there is an unlimited supply. Complete abundance is incredible for some things, but property rights require scarcity. 
	Before NFTs were created, all digital property had no value. If it carried some value, it was within the confines of a closed ecosystem, a walled garden such as a single application, a single video game, a single world. To enforce scarcity you needed trust in the system, you needed their approval, and you could not step outside of it to take your items

something is the cost that it costs you to produce a new version of an item once you incur the initial cost.

So once you have a computer have a computer right here, once you have a computer, the cost of producing a new unit of information is effectively. Meaning, right. I have a new image and I transfer you that image because it's basically cost me Sierra to replicate that image. Both you have the image and I have the image.

If I have a song, you know, if I, if I own a song and I send you a song, it's not like I have to delete the song and then send it to you, right? Like it's I have a song and you have a song that information is free to replicate in, in the current age, right. In the internet. It's information is free to replicate.

Now that has been a huge blow to the traditional model that that music industry, for example, has been, has, you know, was operating, right? Like once Napster came out, basically people realized that, wow, I can, I can basically have a song on my computer uploaded online. And that anyone that has a connection to the internet can actually.

Downloaded the same song from my, from my right. Like download a copy of the song and, and information can basically replicate infinitely. Right. And they were incredibly scared of this concept. Right. But then, then came like there was naps or Limewire and all these things and that people were, were basically duplicating information infinitely.

Right. And then those things started getting taken down and then came BitTorrent. Right. Which was a sort of decentralized way of hosting this information. So you couldn't actually take it out. Right. It's like, it's a completely peer to peer system. Right. Napster was the first iteration and it was, it was more centralized Napster and Limewire and, and people could take down those companies, but then Victorian came and like, you know, now torrents are hosted.

Are there, there's a million mirrors of the Torin site and it's distributed across the globe and everyone can download this information. Right. And so, and so in the internet, the way that current information technology. Information is free to, to be replicated. Right. And that means that there is no scar city in digital information.

Right. And digital rights management has failed. Right? Like as soon as something gets uploaded to Netflix, it's actually free to copy it throughout the world. Right. And, and people do this, right? Like you, if you don't have a Netflix account, you connect with just Google, like the show that you're doing, and you have to, you know, maybe go to like the second or third page of Google, but you will find a PR a place where it's hosted online, where you can watch it for free.

You don't actually have to paint Netflix people in the U S end up paying Netflix, but people in Guatemala where I'm from, like they just end up copying that stuff. Right. A lot of the time. And and people do that in the U S right? Like, that's been the digital rights management has been a problem ever since the internet became popular.

Yeah. Now MFT. Are there sort of the next iteration, digital rights management in which you can actually link a certificate of authenticity with one particular piece of information, right. And you reintroduce scarcity into the, into the, into the picture because you cannot, because it is it is so secure that you cannot alter the records in the blockchain, that the certificate of authenticity can't be infinitely replicated as the piece of information cap.

Right? So when you have it enough to, you have certificate of authenticity and then like the, the information can still be infinitely replicated, right? Right. Click save. You can save the boarding yacht club, but the value in the board APL club picture is not in the picture itself. It's in the certificate of authenticity is the thing that can't be replicated.

So you're, you're re-introducing star city into a model that has infinite replica. Right. And that is extremely valuable before we had like a decentralized certificate of authenticity. You actually didn't have a way of introducing scarcity in the digital world. Right. And, and if you did, it was run by a centralized institution.

That was completely that that could get hacked, that could get affected. That was, you know, that basically had like the, the ultimate say on what to do with that, with that piece of data right now you have a completely decentralized open source certificate of authenticity that basically you, you becomes more valuable than the thing itself, right?

Like the thing itself is still infinitely replicable, but now you have an. Scars certificate of authenticity. That proves, right. So now when you have something like, like music or like images, like videos and stuff like that, that have, that have attached that certificate part, this authenticity with an NFT.

Now the value of holding that certificate is the thing that is more valuable than the value of owning that piece of data. You're still gonna be able to pirate music. You're still going to be able to pirate like the two right. Click and save images. Right. But the value is going to be in the certificate of authenticity.

So, so what are people doing? They're basically infusing the certificate of authenticity that is cryptographically verified in decentralized way. And that has an open programming interface. You can add more functionality to the certificate of authenticity. They're infusing it with more and more functionality.

So the, so the certificate is the thing that's worth more than the piece of data that's infinitely replicable. So that's what NFTs are. And so that's why I'm so bullish on them because you are reintroducing scar scarcity into a system that doesn't have it and cannot have property rights.
