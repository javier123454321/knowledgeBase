Summary:
	**The Law of the Lid**
		Your ability to be succesful is capped by your ability to lead. Leadership ability is 'the lid'. You can strive for incremental gains in effectiveness, but without leadership, you don't actually get to multiply your efforts.
		To change the direction of an organization, you change the leader, not the organization.
			That tells you how important a leader is. With a bad leader, an organization is doomed.
	**The Law of Influence**
		Without influence, you cannot lead others. 
		**Myths about leadership**
			**Leadership is like management.** 
				The main difference between the two is that leadership is about influencing people to follow while management focuses on maintaining systems and processes. Management can maintain direction, but to change direction, you need influence. [Leadership is aligning individual's goals with your own goals](Leadership%20is%20aligning%20individual's%20goals%20with%20your%20own%20goals.md)
			**The Entrepreneur Myth**
				Sales and entrepreneurship are not about leadership. With sales especially, it is often about convincing or tricking people for a moment, but often you have no long term influence over them.
	**The Law of Process**
		Leadership is a quality developed daily. Learning is a lifelong thing, especially in leadership. It comes to the test when your preparation meets a situation that you need it.
	**The Law of Navigation**
		Leadership is seeing ahead of others and planning for it. Anyone can steer, but leaders map the course.
		The first expedition to antartica was meticulously planned, required knowledge of the local habits in the snow and knowledge of the men that were going on it. 
		Leadership is recognizing sub leaders, and then influencing them to let them influence their 'followers'
	**The Law of E.F Hutton**
		When the real leader speaks, people listen. There is a difference between 'positional' leadership and actual of 'influential' leadership. One is about fake roles assigned but not always earned, while the other is impossible to fake. 
		To gain 'real' leadership, you need to understand who is actually leading and work together, not against.
	**The Law of Solid Ground**
		Leadership is about doing the right thing, with integrity and character. You can only violate this law for so long. Each transaction either adds change to your pocket or spends change from your pocket. Once you run out it is very difficult to gain it back.
		Character, admitting mistakes, and putting others before yourself is the way that you move the organization forward. Without this, you loose influence.
	**The Law of Respect**
		Leaders respect leaders, and will only follow people whose leadership is greater than theirs. 
	**The Law of Intuition**
		Leadership requires looking at a situation and knowing what to do instinctively. This is built through preparation and knowledge. 
		Leaders can read a room and know who is with and who is against.
		Leaders can rely on this intuition and do things because it is right, even if it is immediately disagreed by the other people in the room
			This has a higher risk of failure, but as a leader you have to take extreme ownership of the actions that you decided to take.
	**The Law of Magnetism**
		Qualities of people that I would like to attract to my team:
			- Determined, knowledgeable, and dilligent [x]
			- Long term thinkers [x]
			- idealists about building a better future [x]
			- Have the ability to inspire others - Missing somewhat in myselg
		Who you get is determined by who you are, not what you want. You attract others like yourself.
			You actually need to seek out those that are unlike yourself, because you want to staff your weaknesses.
		Things that get aligned with you as a person in the people you attract:
			Attitude
			Generation
			Background
			Values
			Life Experience
			Leadership Ability
	**The Law of Connection**
		Leaders touch hearts before asking for a hand. Instead of seeing a platoon, great commanders see individuals. Each with their aspirations and goals. Connecting and being attuned to that is paramount in leadership.
		Getting to know the individuals in the teams and their aspirations is a superpower in leadership.
		Touching them before asking for a hand. Letting people know that you care. Building a relationship.
	**The Law of the Inner Circle**
		Surround yourself with other leaders to achieve more. Getting people with good leadership qualitites makes your efforts multiply. The goal is to make an organization that is able to raise people into positions of leadership.
		Be a person that lifts people up, not that puts them down.
		The lone ranger cannot be a leader because you need people with you to lead.
		After you have optimized how much you can work, and how much you can achieve (working smarter AND harder) the only thing left to improve is how much you can leverage your leadership to influence others and achieve more.
	**The law of Empowerment**
		Allow others to make you dispensable. If you have the ability to raise others to the point where you are dispensable, that is so valuable that you in fact become indispensable yourself.
		Empowering others to do their best works requires security in your abilities as a leader, and is the only way to achieve excellent results.
	**The Law of Reproduction**
		Secure leaders that can embody the law of empowerment, can generate other secure leaders. 
		People can only produce these results if they live them themselves, no other way.
	**The Law Of Buy In**
		People follow the leader first, then the vision. They won't follow you if they don't believe in you. If they believe in you, then they'll hear your vision.
		Gandhi got people to believe in him so much that they gave their lives, they changed their revolutionary tactics, and they achieved their goal in hte end. 
		Your success as a leader is not measured by your intentions, it is measured by your ability to get people where they need to go.
	**The Law of Victory**
		Great leaders are fighting for something so important that losing is an impossible scenario. The cause is so great, that they are seen as dispensable, they can be embarrassed and wrong so long as the cause triumphs. This makes them indispensable, right, and come out on top. 
		This is true, but it doesn't matter what game they are in, leaders play to win. 
		3 Keys to succeed:
			**Unity of Vision** - Everyone must be on the same page about the goal and strategy
			**Diversity of Skills**
			**A Leader Dedicated to Victory and Raising Players to their Potential** - You need great athletes to win, no matter how good the leader is. But, you can loose them with bad leadership. 
	**The Law of Momentum**
		Only a leader can create momentum, but once there is momentum, effects begin to compound
		Momentum gives people the ability to perform beyond their capabilities.
		Getting started is a struggle, but once you're moving it gets easier and efforts get multiplied.
	**The Law of Priorities**
		Just because you are doing more, doesn't mean you are being succesful. You need to know your priorities.
		What is Required?
			Everything required that is not necessary for me to carry out should be delegated
		What Gives the Greatest Return?
			As a leader work on your areas of greatest strength. If something can be done 80% as well by someone else, allow them to do so.
		What Brings the Greatest Reward?
			What will inspire and ignite the heart?
		Every activity should be made to address the greatest priorities. The goal is not activity but the priority. Basically, are you spread out or are you doing the things that bring the highest rewards.
	**The Law Of Sacrifice**
		Being a leader means sacrificing yourself for the goal. Doing what is best for the outcome, rather than for yourself. 
		The more leadership status you have, the less rights you have, and the more responsibilities.
	**The Law Of Timing**
		The right idea at the right time. You need to see that, and you need to do that. Anything else puts a limit into what you can achieve.
	**The Law Of Legacy**
		It's what you leave behind that marks you as a leader. Are you building up other leaders that will succeed you better than yourself?
