Day 2 of the [[polyphasic sleep]] experiment

Waking up was much harder today than yesterday during my first trial day. I have been awake for an hour now and still feel groggy. I am looking forward to my nap. 

At 3:00 am, I don't feel like doing anything productive, actually felt like a zombie and went straight to the couch to browse TikTok, not a great feeling overall. Might take a few moments of chill before attempting work. 

Sleep Cycle
