# The 5 Layer Network Model

## 1 Physical Layer ##
Actual things which make networks, the cables, etc.
Specs for network cables and how signals are sent between devices

## 2 Data Link Layer ##
Defining a common way to interpret signals in network devices.
Ethernet define protocol to get data to nodes.

## Network Layer ##
Gets the data from one location to the next one. 

### client vs server ###
client initiates the request where the server receives. These are the nodes.

## 4 Transport Layer ##
TCP - Transfer Control Protocol
UDP - User Datagram Protocol
