# The Physical Layer

Means of transmitting bits accrss computer networks
## Bits 
The smallest unit of information that a computer can understand. 1s and 0s

## Modulation 
Varying the voltage of a charge accross a cable. 
### Line Coding 
Makes the other device understand one or 0

## Twisted Pair Cable 

Literally copper wires twisted together. 

## Duplex Communication vs Simplex Communication
Dual vs Singular direction of information transfer.

Cables that are twisted are reserved partially for one direction and the rest for the opposite. 

Half duplex means that a device can communicate back and forth but not simultaneously.
