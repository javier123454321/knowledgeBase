        - people make decisions and then justify them rationally, not the other way around
    - Pelosi calls the 25th amendment to kick out Trump out of office
        - At first glance this seems like the most literal anti democratic action taken by the democrats to this date. 
        - I don't think that democrats are thinking tactically about the implications of this. This in my mind reifies support for the president. Reminds me of the impeachment process, where impeachment was proposed, and the reason for it kept being updated. 
            - The impeachment process started before Trump took office. That is crazy.
    - My issue with libertarianism is that, just like [[communism]], it depends on an idealized notion of the world which does not correspond with any reality whatsoever.
        - In its practice, libertarianism applied (pure capitalism without any structured intereference imposed on the market) looks like our crony capitalism today.
        - In practice, [[communism]] applied (collective control over resources) looks like the tankism of the Soviet Union.
        - By this declaration, libertarianism seems more favorable in this regard, although the premise seems faulty. There has to be a better solution than today's liberalism
