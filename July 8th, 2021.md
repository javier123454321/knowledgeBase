            - The consulting trap:
                - You get much higher than you are worth at a young age, you get much less than you are worth as you gain experience
        - Specialization in 3 verticals
        - Networking
            - If your linkedin feed gives you better job listings than your network 7 years in, you are doing something wrong
        - Investing
        - Take a job under these conditions:
            - You can leverage the skills to grow your career or business
            - You can do it in addition to your business
            - Consider career options that provide revenue participation and equity early on
        - Build a venture or side venture
            - Determine the customer - masses or one percent
        - Fitness
            - This is a long game, invest in your tool (your body)
    - [[Architecture]] vs [[Software Engineering]] Cultures around problems
        - Based on this [[Article]] and thread which relates to: 
            - Honestly, the biggest difference is the former's approach to depth of understanding the domain which it is working on. In programming culture, it is all about the tool you use, the problem space is secondary, in architecture, business concerns are necessary as it is more of a consulting relationship.

            - Product vs Infrastructure Engineers
                - https://www.michellelim.org/writing/stop-using-frontend-backend/
                - You can be product focused and work on the backend, this is fine. Being product focused and working on the infrastructure, it becomes dreadful
                    - This maps 1 to 1 to my relationship with QA role at Celltrak. I really disliked it because it was just too far removed from the personal. I kept talking about it as a creativity block, but I was coding infrastucture, which required creativity, but was too divorced from product.

- [[Literature Notes]]
    - Software development can be categorized with two mentalities. Product vs Engineer mentality. This division marks the difference of a company that advertises what they do vs how they do things. Product focused engineering is much more aligned with the end result, how it connects to the end user, how it benefits people in the end. Engineer mentality focuses on how it solves a problem, how it is a technically superior decision over another one. Which systems are in place to make this into a solid foundation for future technical work.

            - I vibe much more with product focused engineering, but whenever I run into a reductive categorization axis, I tend to circle towards the center, as both ends have beneficial attributes to them.
