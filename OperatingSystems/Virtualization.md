# Virtualization

Computers function by transforming a physical resource into *virtual*
versions of itself in this process called Virtualization. The OS will
then expose some native functionality through system calls (APIs or
Standard Libraries). Virtualization allows for shared time (concurrency)
and Memory (resources) CPUs are sometimes considered resource managers.

A CPU, even when single threaded can simulate a concurrent computation
through virtualization. It has policies on how it does that.
