## The circle of fifths

Sharps  <-         -> Flats               Flats  <-            -> Sharps 
              C                                          C
       G              F                           F             G
                                 
   D                       Bb               Bb                       D
                      
                                                                      
 A                           Eb           Eb                           A
                      
                                                              
   E                      Ab                Ab                      E
        Cb            C#                         Db            B
        B     F#      Db                         C#     Gb     Cb
              Gb                                        F#

C has no accidentals
F has one Flat
B has two ...

### Deriving the keys when you travel towards the flats

The fourth is the new flat.

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
F  G  A  Bb C  D  E  F

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
Bb C  D  Eb F  G  A  Bb


### Deriving the keys when you travel towards the flats
The 7th becomes the next sharp

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
G  A  B  C  D  E  F# G

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
D  E  F# G  A  B  C# D

They go up to 7 sharps or 7 flats
C# or Cb

    C       |  0 accidentals
G       F   |  1 accidentals
D       Bb  |  2 accidentals
A       Eb  |  3 accidentals
E       Ab  |  4 accidentals
B       Db  |  5 accidentals
F#      Gb  |  6 accidentals
C#      Cb  |  7 accidentals


## Minor Scales
*All minor scales are defined by lowering the third.*

## Types of Minor Scales

- Natural  - Start with Major and drop the 3d 6th and 7th notes a half step
- Harmonic - Start with Major and drop the 3rd and 6th notes a half step
- Melodic  - Start with Major and drop the 3rd

### Natural
For the C minor scale

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C 
      Eb       Ab Bb  

### Harmonic
For the C minor Harmonic scale

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C 
      Eb       Ab  

### Melodic
Is one scale going down and another scale going up

For the C minor Melodic scale ascending

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C 
      Eb

For the C minor Melodic scale descending it is the same as Harmonic Minor

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C 
      Eb       Ab Bb


There is a difference where you are going to and where you are coming from


## Lesson 2
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV5bD6nBQQc&list=RDQMTWqSLtfI0Iw&index=2](Youtube)

Each key has the major and a relative (natural) minor scale. So if you take a key like D major:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
D  E  F# G  A  B  C# D


You must find the Natural minor with two sharps (the B minor)

                                      ^
Take any major scale and start on the 6 to play the minor.

So take the 6th degree of a major to play a minor.

Major  |  Minor
  C    |    A
  G    |    E
  D    |    B
  A    |    Gb
  E    |    Db
  B    |    Ab
  Gb   |    Eb
  Db   |    Bb
  Ab   |    F
  Eb   |    C
  Bb   |    G
  F    |    D


So taking G Major to Natural Minor

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
G  A  B  C  D  E  F# G
               1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
               E  F# G  A  B  C  D  E    <- Natural Minor
                     G#          D#      <- Harmonic Minor
                     G#                  <- Ascending Melodic Minor

## Intervals

They are diferent wether you are dealing with the 

8 5 4 1
Can be Augmented Perfect or Diminished

7 6 3 2
Can be Major Minor augmented or dimished

if you are playing two notes and the top note is in the major scale of the bottom note

play a 1 and a 6
G and E   (major)
G and Eb  (minor)
G and Ebb (diminished)
G and E#  (augmented)

for 1 and 4
Bb and A   (augmented fourth)
Bb and Ab  (perfect)
Bb and Abb (diminished)
