# AWS EC2
[aws.amazon.com]aws.amazon.com/ecs/instance-types/

## Elastic Compute Cloud
Secure resizeable compute capacity in the cloud.

Compute is the part of the cloud that crunches the data. (a virtualized server)

Easy to provision and allow for up/down scaling easily

## Servers
A server is a computer that has software to serve data

An EC2 instance is you renting a server.
Amazon's servers are compartamentalized into a bunch of different partitions.

## Instance Types

Computer needs vary from user to user, gaming, programming, machine learnig.

Amazon offers a selection of instance types to give cpu power (or priority access to compute power), Ram, data transfer, etc. 

#### Main Categories
- CPU
- Memory
- Storage

Instance types are optimized for different use cases. 

EC2 A1 are scaled out for arm based workloads. Arm based have different computer architecture.

## T3 instances
The most commonly used
Higher bandwidth

## Compute Optimized (C Instances)
Choose processors, size, etc 

## Accelerated Computing P Inf, G, F
Hardware based acceleration

## Storage Optimized I, D, H
If an application that is not necessarily 

It boils down to Class, then Size


## On Demand Pricing

Easiest to use, only pay for what you use.

Allows you to get amazing computer power at your fingerprints, immediately as you need.

## Reserving Servers

Aws has a finite capcity of resources. If you are certain of a service and you secure yourself space, and guarantee compute power.
Cheaper if you pay up front.
